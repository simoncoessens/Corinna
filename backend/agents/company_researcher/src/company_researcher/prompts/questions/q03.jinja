## Research Question

Does the service enable transactions in Euro (EUR) or other national currencies of EU Member States (e.g., PLN, SEK, HUF)?

## Research Strategy

1. Use web_search to find the information:
   - Review the payment policy or initiate a mock checkout process to identify which currencies are accepted
   - Determine if the service accepts payments in Euro (EUR) or other national currencies of EU Member States (e.g., PLN - Polish Złoty, SEK - Swedish Krona, CZK - Czech Koruna, HUF - Hungarian Forint)
   - Check payment pages, checkout processes, pricing pages, and terms of service for currency information
   - Search with specific queries including the company name and terms like "payment currency", "accepted currencies", "EUR", "Euro"
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

2. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - From search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

3. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from search results).

## Guidelines

- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
