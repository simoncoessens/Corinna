## Research Question

What is the estimated number of monthly active users of the service in the European Union?

## Research Strategy

1. Use web_search to find the information:
   - Locate Information on monthly active users published by the provider for the European Union
   - Extract the specific number of monthly active users of the service in the EU declared by the provider
   - If no specific report exists, search for recent press releases or investor reports mentioning EU user numbers
   - Search with specific queries including the company name
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

2. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - From search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

3. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from search results).

## Guidelines

- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
