## Research Question

What is the estimated number of monthly active users of the service in the European Union?

## Research Strategy

**IMPORTANT: Check the Company Summary first!**

1. **Review the Company Summary** (if provided above) - The summary may already contain the answer or enough information to infer it. If you can confidently answer from the summary, call finish_research immediately without searching.

2. **If the summary doesn't answer the question**, use web_search to find the information:
   - Locate Information on monthly active users published by the provider for the European Union
   - Extract the specific number of monthly active users of the service in the EU declared by the provider
   - If no specific report exists, search for recent press releases or investor reports mentioning EU user numbers
   - Search with specific queries including the company name
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

3. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - Whether from the summary or search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

4. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from summary or search results).

## Guidelines

- **Check the Company Summary FIRST** - If it contains the answer, use finish_research without searching
- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
