## Research Question

Does your service operate as a 'Hosting Service' under the DSA? (i.e., you store information provided by users at their request on a more than temporary basis?)

## Context

**Module C: The "Hosting" Investigation (Art. 3(g)(iii))**

A **hosting service** is defined as an information society service that consists of the **storage of information provided by, and at the request of, a recipient of the service**. This type of service is one of the three main categories of intermediary services addressed by the Regulation, alongside "mere conduit" and "caching" services. The services listed as examples of hosting services are diverse and span a wide range of online economic activities.

**General Examples of Hosting Services:**
- Cloud computing
- Web hosting
- Paid referencing services
- Services enabling sharing information and content online, including file storage and sharing
- Online Platforms
- Online marketplaces

## Research Strategy

1. Use web_search to find the information:
   - Search for information about whether the company stores information provided by users at their request on a more than temporary basis
   - Check if the service matches examples like cloud computing, web hosting, file storage and sharing, online platforms, or online marketplaces
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

2. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - From search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

3. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from search results).

## Guidelines

- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
