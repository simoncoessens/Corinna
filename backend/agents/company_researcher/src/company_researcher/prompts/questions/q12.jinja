Your task is to find specific, factual information to answer the research question.

## Research Question

Does your service operate as an 'Online Search Engine' under the DSA? (i.e., you allow users to input queries to perform searches of the entire web)

## Context

**Module F: Search Engine Assessment (Art. 3(j) DSA)**

An **Online Search Engine** is defined as a type of intermediary service that is crucial for locating and making information retrievable online. An online search engine is an intermediary service that allows users to input queries in order to perform searches of, in principle, all websites, or all websites in a particular language, on the basis of a query on any subject in the form of a keyword, voice request, phrase or other input, and returns results in any format in which information related to the requested content can be found.

**Classification as Intermediary Service:** The definition explicitly describes an online search engine as an intermediary service. However, the DSA does not list "online search engine" as one of the three main categories of intermediary services ("mere conduit," "caching," or "hosting").

**Exclusions:** The definition is broadly drafted to cover general web search engines but excludes search functions limited to the content of a specific website and price comparison websites.

**Examples:**
- **Online Search Engines (General):** Online search engines are considered providers of services that establish and facilitate the underlying logical architecture and proper functioning of the internet, including technical auxiliary functions.
- **Very Large Online Search Engine (VLOSE)** refers to an online search engine designated by the European Commission as having a particularly significant reach and societal impact within the Union. A VLOSE is characterized by three cumulative criteria:
  - **Service Type:** It must be an **online search engine**. An **online search engine** is defined as an intermediary service that allows users to input queries to search, in principle, **all websites** (or all websites in a particular language), returning results in any format.
  - **Reach Threshold:** It must have a number of **average monthly active recipients of the service in the Union** equal to or **higher than 45 million**
  - **Designation:** The VLOSE must be **designated** by the European Commission

## Research Strategy

**IMPORTANT: Check the Company Summary first!**

1. **Review the Company Summary** (if provided above) - The summary may already contain the answer or enough information to infer it. If you can confidently answer from the summary, call finish_research immediately without searching.

2. **If the summary doesn't answer the question**, use web_search to find the information:
   - Search for information about whether the service allows users to input queries to perform searches of the entire web (or all websites in a particular language)
   - Determine if the service is a general web search engine (not limited to a specific website's content or a price comparison website)
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

3. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - Whether from the summary or search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

4. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from summary or search results).

## Guidelines

- **Check the Company Summary FIRST** - If it contains the answer, use finish_research without searching
- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
