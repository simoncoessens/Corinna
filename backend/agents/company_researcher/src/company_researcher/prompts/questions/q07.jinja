## Research Question

Is the service technically accessible from IP addresses within the Union (i.e., is it free of geo-blocking measures)?

## Research Strategy

1. Use web_search to find the information:
   - Verify if the main website of the provider/service is technically accessible from IP addresses located within the European Union
   - Determine if the service implements geo-blocking measures preventing access from the EU
   - Check for information about regional restrictions, IP blocking, geographic access limitations, or geo-blocking policies
   - Look for terms of service, access policies, or user reports about EU accessibility
   - Search with specific queries including the company name and terms like "geo-blocking", "EU access", "European Union", "geographic restrictions", "IP blocking"
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

2. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - From search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

3. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from search results).

## Guidelines

- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
