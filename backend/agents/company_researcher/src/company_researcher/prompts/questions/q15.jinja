## Research Question

Does your service operate as an 'Online Marketplace'? (i.e., you allow third-party sellers to sell products or services directly to consumers on your platform)

## Context

**Module E: Online Marketplace Assessment (The "Trader" Check)**

An **Online Marketplace** is a specific, regulated category of **online platform** defined by its function of **allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders**. This service falls under the larger definition of a **hosting service**, meaning it stores and disseminates information to the public at the request of a recipient of the service, such as a trader.

Definition trader: trader means any natural person, or any legal person irrespective of whether it is privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any person acting in his or her name or on his or her behalf, for purposes relating to his or her trade, business, craft or profession;

**Definition of Distance Contract:** For the purposes of this Regulation, a **distance contract** is defined by reference to Directive 2011/83/EU. The definition includes:
- **Article 2, point (7), of Directive 2011/83/EU:** '**distance contract**' means any contract concluded between the trader and the consumer under an organised distance sales or service-provision scheme without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance communication up to and including the time at which the contract is concluded.
- **Recital 20 - Directive 2011/83/EU:** '**distance contract**' means any contract concluded between the trader and the consumer under an organised distance sales or service-provision scheme without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance communication (such as mail order, Internet, telephone or fax) up to and including the time at which the contract is concluded.

**Example of an Online Marketplace:**
- A form of **"hybrid" online marketplace** falls within the material scope of the Regulation. This refers to marketplaces **on which the provider both offers its own goods for sale (acting as an online retailer) and allows third parties to offer their goods for sale to consumers**.
- Additionally, the definition encompasses platforms allowing consumers and traders to conclude online sales and service contracts **on the platform's interface**, excluding sites that merely redirect consumers to the trader's website, which are more akin to caching or online search engines.

## Research Strategy

1. Use web_search to find the information:
   - Search for information about whether the service allows third-party sellers to sell products or services directly to consumers on the platform
   - Determine if the platform allows consumers and traders to conclude distance contracts (online sales/service contracts without simultaneous physical presence) on the platform's interface
   - Check if the service is a "hybrid" marketplace where the provider both offers its own goods and allows third parties to sell (these are included)
   - Note that sites that merely redirect consumers to the trader's website are excluded (they are more like caching or search engines)
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

2. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - From search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

3. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from search results).

## Guidelines

- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
