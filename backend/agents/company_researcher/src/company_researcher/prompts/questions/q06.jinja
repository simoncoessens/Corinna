## Research Question

Is your mobile app available for download in European Union countries appstores?

## Research Strategy

1. Use web_search to find the information:
   - Search the Apple App Store and Google Play Store listings for the provider/service
   - Determine if the application is available for download in the national storefronts of major EU Member States (e.g., France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands)
   - Check for availability in country-specific app stores or EU-specific app store regions
   - Look for information about app store availability, regional restrictions, or country-specific listings
   - Search with specific queries including the company name and terms like "app store", "Google Play", "iOS app", "EU countries", "available in Europe"
   - **If no app is found and no sources mention an app for this service, answer that there is no app available for that service**
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

2. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - From search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

3. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from search results).

## Guidelines

- **If no app is found** - If searches return no results for an app and no sources mention an app for this service, answer that there is no app available for that service
- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
