## Research Question

In your last closed financial year, was your company's annual turnover OR its total balance sheet €10 million or less?

## Research Strategy

1. Use web_search to find the information:
   - Locate the most recent 'Consolidated Financial Statement' or 'Annual Report' for the provider
   - Extract two values: 1) 'Total Revenue' (or Turnover) and 2) 'Total Assets' (Balance Sheet Total) for the last closed financial year
   - Convert non-EUR currencies to EUR using the average exchange rate of that reporting year if needed
   - Compare both values against the €10 million threshold - the company qualifies if EITHER turnover OR balance sheet is €10 million or less
   - **Note:** Under the SME Recommendation (Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC), an enterprise needs to pass the Headcount test AND (Turnover Test OR Balance Sheet Test) - you only need to satisfy one of these two financial conditions
   - Use consolidated group figures if the entity is not autonomous
   - Search with specific queries including the company name and terms like "annual report", "financial statement", "turnover", "revenue", "balance sheet", "total assets"
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

2. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - From search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

3. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from search results).

## Guidelines

- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
