## Research Question

Does your service operate as a 'Mere conduit service' under the DSA? (i.e. you strictly transmit data or provide internet access, without modifying or permanently storing the content)

## Context

**The "Mere Conduit" Investigation (Art. 3(g)(i))**

A **'mere conduit' service** is defined as an information society service consisting of the **transmission in a communication network of information provided by a recipient of the service**, or the **provision of access to a communication network** [Article 3(g.i)]. This definition includes the **automatic, intermediate and transient storage** of the transmitted information, provided that this storage takes place for the **sole purpose of carrying out the transmission in the communication network**, and the information is not stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary for the transmission.

Mere conduit services are described as generic categories of services that are crucial for ensuring the smooth and efficient transmission of information delivered on the internet. Examples include:
- Internet exchange points
- Wireless access points or wireless local area networks
- Virtual private networks (VPNs)
- Domain name system (DNS) services and resolvers
- Top-level domain name registries and registrars
- Certificate authorities that issue digital certificates
- Voice over IP and other interpersonal communication services
- Internet access service

## Research Strategy

1. Use web_search to find the information:
   - Search for information about the company's services and whether they strictly transmit data or provide internet access without modifying or permanently storing content
   - Check if the service matches any of the examples of mere conduit services listed above
   - Only one query is executed per call - use separate tool calls for different queries if needed
   - After each search, evaluate if the results answer the question

2. **Stop as soon as you have the answer** - From search results, call finish_research immediately when you have enough information. Do NOT continue searching unnecessarily.

3. **Be decisive** - Once you have enough information (even if incomplete), call finish_research rather than continuing to search.

## Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web with a single query. IMPORTANT: Only one query is executed per call. Use specific queries including the company name. If you need multiple searches, make separate tool calls.
- **finish_research**: Call this when you have enough information to answer the question (from search results).

## Guidelines

- **STOP searching as soon as you have enough information** - Be efficient
- Be concise and factual in your answers
- Include specific numbers, dates, or sources when available
- Maximum {{ max_iterations }} search iterations - if you reach this limit, you MUST call finish_research
