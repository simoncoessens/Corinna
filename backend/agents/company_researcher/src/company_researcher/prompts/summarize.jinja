## Instructions

- The research output shows the reasoning trace. It ends with a conclusion of the research.
- Extract the key information and format it according to the structure below.

### When to set INFORMATION_FOUND: No

Set INFORMATION_FOUND to "No" ONLY when:
- The search did not return anything relevant to the question
- No relevant answers or information were found in the search results
- The research output indicates that no information could be located

### When to set INFORMATION_FOUND: Yes

Set INFORMATION_FOUND to "Yes" if:
- The search returned any information that is relevant to the question (even if partial or uncertain)
- The tool has an idea of the answer, even if not entirely sure
- Any relevant information was found, regardless of confidence level

### Confidence Levels

- **High**: Clear, specific, and well-sourced information that directly answers the question
- **Medium**: Relevant information found, but may be incomplete or from less authoritative sources
- **Low**: Some relevant information found, but uncertain, incomplete, or the answer is inferred rather than explicitly stated

**Important**: If you have any idea of the answer (even if uncertain), set INFORMATION_FOUND to "Yes" and use Low confidence. Only use "No" when absolutely no relevant information was found.

Respond in EXACTLY this format:

INFORMATION_FOUND: [Yes/No]
ANSWER: [1-2 sentences with specific facts. If INFORMATION_FOUND is No, set ANSWER to exactly: "Information not publicly available".]
SOURCE: [Main source domain, e.g., "company.com". If INFORMATION_FOUND is No, set SOURCE to exactly: "N/A".]
CONFIDENCE: [High/Medium/Low. If INFORMATION_FOUND is No, set CONFIDENCE to exactly: "Low".]
