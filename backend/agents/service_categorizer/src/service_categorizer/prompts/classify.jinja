## Legal Framework

### Territorial Scope
- Article 2 - This Regulation shall apply to intermediary services offered to recipients of the service that have their place of establishment or are located in the Union, irrespective of where the providers of those intermediary services have their place of establishment. 

- Article 3 (d) - to offer services in the Union means enabling natural or legal persons in one or more Member States to use the services of a provider of intermediary services that has a substantial connection to the Union;

- Article 3 (e) - substantial connection to the Union means a connection of a provider of intermediary services with the Union resulting either from its establishment in the Union or from specific factual criteria, such as a significant number of recipients of the service in one or more Member States in relation to its or their population or the targeting of activities towards one or more Member States;“


- Recital 7/8 - In order to ensure the effectiveness of the rules laid down in this Regulation and a level playing field within the internal market, those rules should apply to providers of intermediary services irrespective of their place of establishment or their location, in so far as they offer services in the Union, as evidenced by a substantial connection to the Union.  Such a substantial connection to the Union should be considered to exist where the service provider has an establishment in the Union OR, in the absence of such an establishment, where the number of recipients of the service in one or more Member States is significant in relation to the population thereof,  or on the basis of the targeting of activities towards one or more Member States. 

The targeting of activities towards one or more Member States can be determined on the basis of all relevant circumstances, including factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in that Member State, or the possibility of ordering products or services, or the use of a relevant top-level domain. The targeting of activities towards a Member State could also be derived from the availability of an application in the relevant national application store, from the provision of local advertising or advertising in a language used in that Member State, or from the handling of customer relations such as by providing customer service in a language generally used in that Member State. 

A substantial connection should also be assumed where a service provider directs its activities to one or more Member States within the meaning of Article 17(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council. 

In contrast, mere technical accessibility of a website from the Union cannot, on that ground alone, be considered as establishing a substantial connection to the Union.”




### Service Categories (Art. 3)
- A **‘mere conduit’ service** (Art. 3(g)(i)) is defined as an information society service consisting of the transmission in a communication network of information provided by a recipient of the service, or the provision of access to a communication network. This definition includes the automatic, intermediate and transient storage of the transmitted information, provided that this storage takes place for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission in the communication network, and the information is not stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary for the transmission. Mere conduit services are described as crucial for ensuring the smooth and efficient transmission of information delivered on the internet. Examples include: Internet exchange points; Wireless access points or wireless local area networks; Virtual private networks (VPNs); Domain name system (DNS) services and resolvers; Top-level domain name registries and registrars; Certificate authorities that issue digital certificates ; Voice over IP and other interpersonal communication services; Internet access service

- A **‘caching’ service** (Art. 3(g)(ii)) is defined as an information society service consisting of the transmission in a communication network of information provided by a recipient of the service. This service involves the automatic, intermediate, and temporary storage of that information. The defining characteristic of caching is that this storage must be performed for the sole purpose of making more efficient or more secure the information's onward transmission to other recipients upon their request. The concept of caching explicitly include services aimed at reinforcing security or resilience, alongside services aimed at enhancing network performance and speed (efficiency). Caching is differentiated from 'mere conduit' because the storage is not transient and ancillary; however, it is different from 'hosting' because the storage is temporary and functional. Caching services are considered crucial for ensuring the smooth and efficient transmission of information delivered on the internet. Examples of caching intermediary services include: the sole provision of content delivery networks, reverse proxies, or content adaptation proxies. Determining whether a specific service qualifies as a ‘caching’ service depends solely on its technical functionalities and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
    
- A **hosting service** (Article 3(g.iii)) is defined as an information society service that consists of the storage of information provided by, and at the request of, a recipient of the service. The services listed as examples of hosting services are diverse and span a wide range of online economic activities: Examples of Hosting Services: Cloud computing; Web hosting; Paid referencing services; Services enabling sharing information and content online, including file storage and sharing; Online Platforms.

- An **online platform** (Article 3(l)) is a specific category of hosting service distinguished by the function of dissemination to the public. An online platform is defined as a hosting service that stores and disseminates information to the public at the request of a recipient of the service. The key distinction is based on the concept of dissemination to the public, which means making information available to a potentially unlimited number of third parties at the request of the service recipient who provided the information. 
  - Process of Dissemination: This means making the information easily accessible to recipients of the service in general, without requiring further action by the recipient who initially provided the information.
  - Access Control: If access requires registration or admittance to a group, the information is only considered disseminated to the public if this admittance is **automatic**, occurring without a human decision or selection process.
  - A Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) is an online platform that has been designated by the European Commission** as having a particularly significant reach and societal impact within the Union. VLOPs are a specifically regulated category of online platforms, which themselves are a subcategory of hosting services that store and disseminate information to the public at the request of the recipient. The application of enhanced obligations to a VLOP is dependent on meeting cumulative criteria. Service Type: The service must be an online platform (a hosting service that stores and disseminates information to the public). Examples of such platforms include social networks and online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders; Reach Threshold: The platform must have a number of **average monthly active recipients of the service in the Union** that is **equal to or higher than 45 million**. This threshold is considered equivalent to **10% of the Union's population**; **Designation:** The platform must be **designated** by the European Commission. Examples. Online platforms are viewed as being services that have enabled businesses and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways. They represent a subcategory of intermediary services designed to facilitate the sharing of content and connecting users. Specific examples of services that constitute online platforms include:Social networks; online marketplaces, defined as platforms that allow consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders. Exclusions and Nuances.** A hosting service is **not** considered an online platform if the dissemination function is deemed incidental to its primary purpose. A service should be excluded where the dissemination to the public is:
    - A minor and purely ancillary feature of another service.
    - A minor functionality of the principal service. For this exception to apply, the feature or functionality must be intrinsically linked to the other/principal service and cannot be used without it for objective technical reasons; furthermore, the integration must not be a means to circumvent the applicability of the Regulation.

**Examples of exclusions:**

- The **comments section in an online newspaper** could be considered such a feature if it is determined to be ancillary to the newspaper’s main service (the publication of news under editorial responsibility).
- **Cloud computing** or **web-hosting services** should not be considered online platforms where the dissemination of specific information to the public constitutes merely a minor and ancillary feature or functionality of those services.
- **Interpersonal communication services** (such as emails or private messaging services) generally fall outside the definition of online platforms because they are intended for communication between a **finite number of persons** determined by the sender. (However, services that allow making information available to a potentially unlimited number of recipients, such as public groups or open channels, may be covered).


- **Module E: Online Marketplace Assessment (The "Trader" Check)**
    - An **Online Marketplace** is a specific, regulated category of **online platform** defined by its function of **allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders**. This service falls under the larger definition of a **hosting service**, meaning it stores and disseminates information to the public at the request of a recipient of the service, such as a trader. Online marketplaces have enabled businesses and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways.
        - **Definition of Distance Contract** For the purposes of this Regulation, a **distance contract** is defined by reference to Directive 2011/83/EU. The definition includes:
        - **Article 2, point (7), of Directive 2011/83/EU:** '**distance contract**' means any contract concluded between the trader and the consumer under an organised distance sales or service-provision scheme without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance communication up to and including the time at which the contract is concluded.
        - **Recital 20 - Directive 2011/83/EU:** '**Distance contract**' means any contract concluded between the trader and the consumer under an organised distance sales or service-provision scheme without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance communication (such as mail order, Internet, telephone or fax) up to and including the time at which the contract is concluded.
    - **Example of an Online Marketplace**
        - A a form of **"hybrid" online marketplace** falls within the material scope of the Regulation. This refers to marketplaces **on which the provider both offers its own goods for sale (acting as an online retailer) and allows third parties to offer their goods for sale to consumers**.
        - Additionally, the definition encompasses platforms allowing consumers and traders to conclude online sales and service contracts **on the platform’s interface**, excluding sites that merely redirect consumers to the trader's website, which are more akin to caching or online search engines.
    
- **Module F: Search Engine Assessment (**Art. 3(j) DSA)
    - An Online Search Engine is defined as a type of intermediary service that is crucial for locating and making information retrievable online. An online search engine is an intermediary service that allows users to input queries in order to perform searches of, in principle, all websites, or all websites in a particular language, on the basis of a query on any subject in the form of a keyword, voice request, phrase or other input, and returns results in any format in which information related to the requested content can be found.
    - Classification as Intermediary Service: The definition explicitly describes an online search engine as an intermediary service. However, the DSA does not list "online search engine" as one of the three main categories of intermediary services ("mere conduit," "caching," or "hosting").
        - Purpose: Search engines facilitate "findability" of data online and, due to their critical role, are sometimes referred to as the "gate-keeper" of the information.
        - Exclusions: The definition is broadly drafted to cover general web search engines but excludes search functions limited to the content of a specific website and price comparison websites.
        - Examples
            - Online Search Engines (General): Online search engines are considered providers of services that establish and facilitate the underlying logical architecture and proper functioning of the internet, including technical auxiliary functions.
            - **Very Large Online Search Engine (VLOSE)** refers to an online search engine designated by the European Commission as having a particularly significant reach and societal impact within the Union. A VLOSE is characterized by three cumulative criteria:
                - **Service Type:** It must be an **online search engine**. An **online search engine** is defined as an intermediary service that allows users to input queries to search, in principle, **all websites** (or all websites in a particular language), returning results in any format.
                - **Reach Threshold:** It must have a number of **average monthly active recipients of the service in the Union** equal to or **higher than 45 million**
                - **Designation:** The VLOSE must be **designated** by the European Commission

### Platform Exceptions (Art. 3(i), Recital 13-14)
NOT a platform if dissemination is:
- Minor/ancillary to main service (e.g., comments on news site)
- Pure infrastructure (cloud/hosting as backend)
- Interpersonal communication (email, private messaging)








### Size Thresholds
- **VLOP/VLOSE**: ≥45 million monthly active EU users
- **SME Exemptions** (Art. 19, 29): <50 employees AND <€10M turnover
