## Legal Framework

### Territorial Scope
- Article 2 - This Regulation shall apply to intermediary services offered to recipients of the service that have their place of establishment or are located in the Union, irrespective of where the providers of those intermediary services have their place of establishment. 

- Article 3 (d) - to offer services in the Union means enabling natural or legal persons in one or more Member States to use the services of a provider of intermediary services that has a substantial connection to the Union;

- Article 3 (e) - substantial connection to the Union means a connection of a provider of intermediary services with the Union resulting either from its establishment in the Union or from specific factual criteria, such as a significant number of recipients of the service in one or more Member States in relation to its or their population or the targeting of activities towards one or more Member States;“


- Recital 7/8 - In order to ensure the effectiveness of the rules laid down in this Regulation and a level playing field within the internal market, those rules should apply to providers of intermediary services irrespective of their place of establishment or their location, in so far as they offer services in the Union, as evidenced by a substantial connection to the Union.  Such a substantial connection to the Union should be considered to exist where the service provider has an establishment in the Union OR, in the absence of such an establishment, where the number of recipients of the service in one or more Member States is significant in relation to the population thereof,  or on the basis of the targeting of activities towards one or more Member States. 

The targeting of activities towards one or more Member States can be determined on the basis of all relevant circumstances, including factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in that Member State, or the possibility of ordering products or services, or the use of a relevant top-level domain. The targeting of activities towards a Member State could also be derived from the availability of an application in the relevant national application store, from the provision of local advertising or advertising in a language used in that Member State, or from the handling of customer relations such as by providing customer service in a language generally used in that Member State. 

A substantial connection should also be assumed where a service provider directs its activities to one or more Member States within the meaning of Article 17(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council. 

In contrast, mere technical accessibility of a website from the Union cannot, on that ground alone, be considered as establishing a substantial connection to the Union.”




### Service Categories (Art. 3)

Article 2.2 - This Regulation shall not apply to any service that is not an intermediary service or to any requirements imposed in respect of such a service, irrespective of whether the service is provided through the use of an intermediary service.

- A **‘mere conduit’ service** (Art. 3(g)(i)) is defined as an information society service consisting of the transmission in a communication network of information provided by a recipient of the service, or the provision of access to a communication network. This definition includes the automatic, intermediate and transient storage of the transmitted information, provided that this storage takes place for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission in the communication network, and the information is not stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary for the transmission. Mere conduit services are described as crucial for ensuring the smooth and efficient transmission of information delivered on the internet. Examples include: Internet exchange points; Wireless access points or wireless local area networks; Virtual private networks (VPNs); Domain name system (DNS) services and resolvers; Top-level domain name registries and registrars; Certificate authorities that issue digital certificates ; Voice over IP and other interpersonal communication services; Internet access service


- A **‘caching’ service** (Art. 3(g)(ii)) is defined as an information society service consisting of the transmission in a communication network of information provided by a recipient of the service. This service involves the automatic, intermediate, and temporary storage of that information. The defining characteristic of caching is that this storage must be performed for the sole purpose of making more efficient or more secure the information's onward transmission to other recipients upon their request. The concept of caching explicitly include services aimed at reinforcing security or resilience, alongside services aimed at enhancing network performance and speed (efficiency). Caching is differentiated from 'mere conduit' because the storage is not transient and ancillary; however, it is different from 'hosting' because the storage is temporary and functional. Caching services are considered crucial for ensuring the smooth and efficient transmission of information delivered on the internet. Examples of caching intermediary services include: the sole provision of content delivery networks, reverse proxies, or content adaptation proxies. Determining whether a specific service qualifies as a ‘caching’ service depends solely on its technical functionalities and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

    
- A **hosting service** (Article 3(g.iii)) is defined as an information society service that consists of the storage of information provided by, and at the request of, a recipient of the service. The services listed as examples of hosting services are diverse and span a wide range of online economic activities: Examples of Hosting Services: Cloud computing; Web hosting; Paid referencing services; Services enabling sharing information and content online, including file storage and sharing; Online Platforms.


- An **online platform** (Article 3(l)) is a specific category of hosting service distinguished by the function of dissemination to the public. An online platform is defined as a hosting service that stores and disseminates information to the public at the request of a recipient of the service. The key distinction is based on the concept of dissemination to the public, which means making information available to a potentially unlimited number of third parties at the request of the service recipient who provided the information. 
  - Process of Dissemination: This means making the information easily accessible to recipients of the service in general, without requiring further action by the recipient who initially provided the information.
  - Access Control: If access requires registration or admittance to a group, the information is only considered disseminated to the public if this admittance is **automatic**, occurring without a human decision or selection process.
  
  - Examples of exclusions:
    - The **comments section in an online newspaper** could be considered such a feature if it is determined to be ancillary to the newspaper’s main service (the publication of news under editorial responsibility).
    - Cloud computing** or **web-hosting services** should not be considered online platforms where the dissemination of specific information to the public constitutes merely a minor and ancillary feature or functionality of those services.
    - Interpersonal communication services (such as emails or private messaging services) generally fall outside the definition of online platforms because they are intended for communication between a **finite number of persons** determined by the sender. (However, services that allow making information available to a potentially unlimited number of recipients, such as public groups or open channels, may be covered).


Article 3(i) - online platform means a hosting service that, at the request of a recipient of the service, stores and disseminates information to the public, unless that activity is a minor and purely ancillary feature of another service or a minor functionality of the principal service and, for objective and technical reasons, cannot be used without that other service, and the integration of the feature or functionality into the other service is not a means to circumvent the applicability of this Regulation
Recital 13 - Considering the particular characteristics of the services concerned and the corresponding need to make the providers thereof subject to certain specific obligations, it is necessary to distinguish, within the broader category of providers of hosting services as defined in this Regulation, the subcategory of online platforms. Online platforms, such as social networks or online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders, should be defined as providers of hosting services that not only store information provided by the recipients of the service at their request, but that also disseminate that information to the public at the request of the recipients of the service. However, in order to avoid imposing overly broad obligations, providers of hosting services should not be considered as online platforms where the dissemination to the public is merely a minor and purely ancillary feature that is intrinsically linked to another service, or a minor functionality of the principal service, and that feature or functionality cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without that other or principal service, and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to circumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation applicable to online platforms. For example, the comments section in an online newspaper could constitute such a feature, where it is clear that it is ancillary to the main service represented by the publication of news under the editorial responsibility of the publisher. In contrast, the storage of comments in a social network should be considered an online platform service where it is clear that it is not a minor feature of the service offered, even if it is ancillary to publishing the posts of recipients of the service. For the purposes of this Regulation, cloud computing or web-hosting services should not be considered to be an online platform where dissemination of specific information to the public constitutes a minor and ancillary feature or a minor functionality of such services. Moreover, cloud computing services and web-hosting services, when serving as infrastructure, such as the underlying infrastructural storage and computing services of an internet-based application, website or online platform, should not in themselves be considered as disseminating to the public information stored or processed at the request of a recipient of the application, website or online platform which they host
Recital 14 - The concept of dissemination to the public, as used in this Regulation, should entail the making available of information to a potentially unlimited number of persons, meaning making the information easily accessible to recipients of the service in general without further action by the recipient of the service providing the information being required, irrespective of whether those persons actually access the information in question. Accordingly, where access to information requires registration or admittance to a group of recipients of the service, that information should be considered to be disseminated to the public only where recipients of the service seeking to access the information are automatically registered or admitted without a human decision or selection of whom to grant access. Interpersonal communication services […]such as emails or private messaging services, fall outside the scope of the definition of online platforms as they are used for interpersonal communication between a finite number of persons determined by the sender of the communication. However, the obligations set out in this Regulation for providers of online platforms may apply to services that allow the making available of information to a potentially unlimited number of recipients, not determined by the sender of the communication, such as through public groups or open channels. Information should be considered disseminated to the public within the meaning of this Regulation only where that dissemination occurs upon the direct request by the recipient of the service that provided the information.
Article 3(p) - “active recipient of an online platform means a recipient of the service that has engaged with an online platform by either requesting the online platform to host information or being exposed to information hosted by the online platform and disseminated through its online interface”

  
  Examples. Online platforms are viewed as being services that have enabled businesses and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways. They represent a subcategory of intermediary services designed to facilitate the sharing of content and connecting users. Specific examples of services that constitute online platforms include:Social networks; online marketplaces, defined as platforms that allow consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders. 
  
  Exclusions and Nuances.** A hosting service is **not** considered an online platform if the dissemination function is deemed incidental to its primary purpose. A service should be excluded where the dissemination to the public is:
    - A minor and purely ancillary feature of another service.
    - A minor functionality of the principal service. For this exception to apply, the feature or functionality must be intrinsically linked to the other/principal service and cannot be used without it for objective technical reasons; furthermore, the integration must not be a means to circumvent the applicability of the Regulation.




-  An **Online Marketplace** is a specific, regulated category of **online platform** defined by its function of **allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders**. This service falls under the larger definition of a **hosting service**, meaning it stores and disseminates information to the public at the request of a recipient of the service, such as a trader. Online marketplaces have enabled businesses and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways.
        - **Definition of Distance Contract** For the purposes of this Regulation, a **distance contract** is defined by reference to Directive 2011/83/EU. The definition includes:
        - **Article 2, point (7), of Directive 2011/83/EU:** '**distance contract**' means any contract concluded between the trader and the consumer under an organised distance sales or service-provision scheme without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance communication up to and including the time at which the contract is concluded.
        - **Recital 20 - Directive 2011/83/EU:** '**Distance contract**' means any contract concluded between the trader and the consumer under an organised distance sales or service-provision scheme without the simultaneous physical presence of the trader and the consumer, with the exclusive use of one or more means of distance communication (such as mail order, Internet, telephone or fax) up to and including the time at which the contract is concluded.
    - **Example of an Online Marketplace**
        - A a form of **"hybrid" online marketplace** falls within the material scope of the Regulation. This refers to marketplaces **on which the provider both offers its own goods for sale (acting as an online retailer) and allows third parties to offer their goods for sale to consumers**.
        - Additionally, the definition encompasses platforms allowing consumers and traders to conclude online sales and service contracts **on the platform’s interface**, excluding sites that merely redirect consumers to the trader's website, which are more akin to caching or online search engines.
    

- An Online Search Engine is defined as a type of intermediary service that is crucial for locating and making information retrievable online. An online search engine is an intermediary service that allows users to input queries in order to perform searches of, in principle, all websites, or all websites in a particular language, on the basis of a query on any subject in the form of a keyword, voice request, phrase or other input, and returns results in any format in which information related to the requested content can be found.
    - Classification as Intermediary Service: The definition explicitly describes an online search engine as an intermediary service. However, the DSA does not list "online search engine" as one of the three main categories of intermediary services ("mere conduit," "caching," or "hosting").
        - Purpose: Search engines facilitate "findability" of data online and, due to their critical role, are sometimes referred to as the "gate-keeper" of the information.
        - Exclusions: The definition is broadly drafted to cover general web search engines but excludes search functions limited to the content of a specific website and price comparison websites.
        - Examples
            - Online Search Engines (General): Online search engines are considered providers of services that establish and facilitate the underlying logical architecture and proper functioning of the internet, including technical auxiliary functions.
            
### Platform Exceptions (Art. 3(i), Recital 13-14)
NOT a online platform if dissemination is:
- Minor/ancillary to main service (e.g., comments on news site)
- Pure infrastructure (cloud/hosting as backend)
- Interpersonal communication (email, private messaging)


### Size Thresholds
- **VLOP/VLOSE**: ≥45 million monthly active EU users

  - A Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) is an online platform that has been designated by the European Commission** as having a particularly significant reach and societal impact within the Union. VLOPs are a specifically regulated category of online platforms, which themselves are a subcategory of hosting services that store and disseminate information to the public at the request of the recipient. The application of enhanced obligations to a VLOP is dependent on meeting cumulative criteria. Service Type: The service must be an online platform (a hosting service that stores and disseminates information to the public). Examples of such platforms include social networks and online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders; Reach Threshold: The platform must have a number of **average monthly active recipients of the service in the Union** that is **equal to or higher than 45 million**. This threshold is considered equivalent to **10% of the Union's population**; **Designation:** The platform must be **designated** by the European Commission. 

- **Very Large Online Search Engine (VLOSE)** refers to an online search engine designated by the European Commission as having a particularly significant reach and societal impact within the Union. A VLOSE is characterized by three cumulative criteria:
  - **Service Type:** It must be an **online search engine**. An **online search engine** is defined as an intermediary service that allows users to input queries to search, in principle, **all websites** (or all websites in a particular language), returning results in any format.
  - **Reach Threshold:** It must have a number of **average monthly active recipients of the service in the Union** equal to or **higher than 45 million**  
  - **Designation:** The VLOSE must be **designated** by the European Commission


- **SME Exemptions** (Art. 19, 29)

Article 2 Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC - The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding €50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding €43 million. Within the SME category, a small enterprise is defined as an enterprise which employs fewer than 50 persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total does not exceed €10 million. Within the SME category, a micro enterprise is defined as an enterprise which employs fewer than 10 persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total does not exceed €2 million.”

Article 19 - Exclusion for micro and small enterprises 1. This Section [SECTION 3 - Additional provisions applicable to providers of online platforms], with the exception of Article 24(3) thereof, shall not apply to providers of online platforms that qualify as micro or small enterprises as defined in Recommendation 2003/361/EC.This Section, with the exception of Article 24(3) thereof, shall not apply to providers of online platforms that previously qualified for the status of a micro or small enterprise as defined in Recommendation 2003/361/EC during the 12 months following their loss of that status pursuant to Article 4(2) thereof, except when they are very large online platforms in accordance with Article 33.2. By derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, this Section shall apply to providers of online platforms that have been designated as very large online platforms in accordance with Article 33, irrespective of whether they qualify as micro or small enterprises.

Article 29 - Exclusion for micro and small enterprises  
1. This Section [SECTION 4  Additional provisions applicable to providers of online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders] shall not apply to providers of online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders that qualify as micro or small enterprises as defined in Recommendation 2003/361/EC.  This Section shall not apply to providers of online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders that previously qualified for the status of a micro or small enterprise as defined in Recommendation 2003/361/EC during the 12 months following their loss of that status pursuant to Article 4(2) thereof, except when they are very large online platforms in accordance with Article 33.  2. By derogation from paragraph 1 of this Article, this Section shall apply to providers of online platforms allowing consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders that have been designated as very large online platforms in accordance with Article 33, irrespective of whether they qualify as micro or small enterprises.

## Classification Guidelines

### General Approach

## Phase 1: Territorial Scope (Art. 2 & 3)
The DSA applies if the service is offered to recipients **in the Union**.
* **Establishment:** If the provider is established in the EU -> **IN SCOPE**.
* **No Establishment:** If established outside the EU, check for **"Substantial Connection"** (Art. 3(e), Recital 8):
    * *Targeting:* Uses local language/currency, local domain (.de, .it, .eu), local advertising, or local customer service.
    * *Significant Users:* Significant number of users in one or more MS.
    * *Mere Accessibility:* The fact that a website is technically accessible in the EU is **NOT** sufficient (Recital 8).

## Phase 2: Service Classification Hierarchy (Art. 3)
*Check these categories in order. A service falls into the most specific category applicable.*

### 1. Intermediary Service (The Base Layer)
Does the service provide a "Mere Conduit," "Caching," or "Hosting" service? (Art 3(g)).
* **Mere Conduit:** Transmission of data or access to a network (ISPs, VPNs, DNS, WiFi). Storage is purely transient.
* **Caching:** Automatic, intermediate, temporary storage for efficiency (CDNs, Reverse Proxies).
* **Hosting:** Storage of information provided by, and at the request of, a recipient (Cloud, Web Hosting).

### 2. Online Search Engine (Distinct Category) (Art. 3(j))
* Allows users to input queries to search *all* (or virtually all) websites.
* *Note:* Search functionality limited to a single website (e.g., a search bar on a news site) is **NOT** an Online Search Engine.

### 3. Online Platform (The "Dissemination" Test) (Art. 3(i))
A Hosting service becomes an **Online Platform** if it **disseminates information to the public** at the request of a recipient.
* **"Public":** Potentially unlimited number of third parties.
* **"Dissemination":** Making accessible without further action by the recipient.
* **EXCEPTION (The "Ancillary" Test):** It is **NOT** a platform if the dissemination is a *minor and purely ancillary feature* of another service (e.g., the comments section of an online newspaper, where the main service is editorial news).

### 4. Online Marketplace (Art. 3(n))
An Online Platform that allows consumers to conclude **distance contracts** with traders.
* *Key:* The contract must be concluded *within* the platform's ecosystem. Pure classifieds (listing sites) where the transaction happens off-site are generally *not* Marketplaces under Art. 3(n), though they remain Online Platforms.

---

## Phase 3: Size Designation
### VLOP/VLOSE (Art. 33)
* **Threshold:** ≥ 45 million monthly active recipients in the EU.
* **Designation:** Legally, a service is only a VLOP/VLOSE if **designated by the Commission**. However, for this assessment, flag if they meet the *potential* criteria.

### SME Exemption (Art. 19 & 29)
Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) are exempt from certain heavy obligations.
* **Criteria (Cumulative):**
    1.  **Headcount:** < 50 employees **AND**
    2.  **Financials:** Annual Turnover ≤ €10M **OR** Balance Sheet Total ≤ €10M.
* *Note:* If *either* Headcount or Financials exceed the limit, they are **NOT** exempt.

### Key Distinctions to Look For
- **Mere Conduit vs Caching**: Mere conduit is transient transmission; caching involves temporary storage for efficiency.
- **Hosting vs Platform**: Hosting stores information; platforms actively disseminate that information to the public.
- **Platform vs Infrastructure**: A service that provides backend infrastructure (like cloud storage for a separate application) is hosting, not a platform, unless it also provides the public-facing interface.
- **Private vs Public**: Services that only allow finite, sender-determined recipients (like private messaging) are not platforms, even if they use hosting.

### Common Patterns
- **E-commerce sites**: Typically online platforms; if they facilitate third-party sellers, they are marketplaces.
- **Social media services**: Usually online platforms (public dissemination).
- **Cloud storage services**: Generally hosting, not platforms, unless they also provide public sharing/public galleries.
- **SaaS applications**: Often not intermediary services if they provide their own content/services rather than hosting user-provided content for others.
- **Content management systems**: Usually hosting; may be platforms if they enable public-facing websites where users can publish content.

### Ambiguous Cases - Decision Framework
1. When information is unclear, err on the side of the more specific classification (e.g., platform over hosting) but document the uncertainty in reasoning.
2. If a service has multiple features, classify based on the primary revenue-generating or core function.
3. For hybrid services (e.g., a service that is both infrastructure and platform), classify as the most regulated applicable category, but note the complexity.
4. Consider the business model: services that primarily monetize through user-generated content dissemination are likely platforms.

### Data Evaluation Priorities
1. **Primary**: Service description, business model, user base characteristics
2. **Secondary**: Company size metrics, geographic presence indicators
3. **Supporting**: Technical architecture details, terms of service references

### Size Designation Guidance
- **VLOP/VLOSE determination**: Requires actual user metrics. Use available data on monthly active users, but note if data is incomplete. The 45 million threshold is absolute.
- **SME exemption**: Both criteria must be met (<50 employees AND <€10M turnover OR). If either metric is unavailable or exceeds the threshold, the exemption does not apply. Consider the grace period (12 months after losing SME status) if applicable. Under the SME Recommendation, an enterprise needs to pass the Headcount test AND (Turnover Test OR Balance Sheet Test). Tooltip: "You only need to satisfy one of these two financial conditions (plus the headcount condition) to qualify as a Small Enterprise.

- **Data availability**: If precise metrics are unavailable, indicate uncertainty but provide best-effort assessment based on available indicators (company size, funding, market presence, competitors).

## Instructions
Analyze the company profile and classify the service. Use chain-of-thought reasoning.
